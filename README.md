Generates a random phrase and automatically adds it to the users keyboard
-------------------------------------------------------------------------   

## Quick Start  
1) Add phrases/text to `text.txt` file  
2) Run the batch file (E.G `./random_phrase.bat`).     
3) Optionally, set a keybind that automatically runs the batch file.   


## Purpose    
With a programmable keyboard or mouse, you can use a program such as ICUE and set the batch file to a button. Then you can press the button, and paste the random message whenever.      
**Trash talking** - Fill the text file with your favorite insults / banter while your opponent (or teammate) wastes their time thinking & typing out responses.    
**Common greetings / Farewell messages** - Fill the text file with general greetings & nice messages for easier sending.
